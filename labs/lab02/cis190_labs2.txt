1. Display help about the ls command while at the command line. Give your command.
	man ls
2. Use the man page to determine how to make "ls" display long listings with file sizes in human-readable format. Give your command.
	ls -lsh
3. Read the man page for the mkdir command. Give the command and describe how to exit the man page.
	man mkdir        q
4. Read the man page for the mkdir command again and this time seach for "parent" in that man page. Give the command you used to seach for parent.
	/parent
5. Reopen the man page for mkdir then suspend that process (This is a review comman form last week). Give the command to suspend.
	
6. Now you are back at the command line, give the command to show suspended jobs. Give the command.
	jobs
7. Give the command to restart your suspended job.
	fg 1
8. Run the command "ls ~/home" with superuser privileges. Give the command and your answer.
	I figured out how to obtain superuser privilages by doing research online, but you have not shown a proper demonstration on how to achieve those privilages. I typed "sudo bash" to gain access to the root command, then typed "passwd", and that prompted me to create a password, I chose and 8+  digit password including at least 1 uppercase, 1 lowercase, 1 number, and 1 symbol. Once I created a password, I then went back to my orginal user account by typing "exit". Once I was back on my account, I typed "su" which prompted me to enter in a password. I typed the password I created and at that point I had superuser privilages. I then tried typing "ls ~/home", I was then told that "this directory doesn't exist." Now, I am lost on this assignment and would like some clarity on where I went wrong.
